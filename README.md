# Steps to run locally

1. Get in the folder where you are going to save your work through the CLI. You can create one with the command:
    ```
    mkdir <your-folder>
    ```
2. Pull the code to your machine with this command:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/jpuseche/node-presentation.git
    ```
3. Run the command:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
    This is to load the necessary modules into your local project.
